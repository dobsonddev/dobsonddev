### I'm Dobson, welcome to my repo ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m junior full-stack dev who loves building real-world solutions. I enjoy collaborative, dynamic work environments that are focused on building healthy, scalable, generalized systems with minimal proprietary bloat - whether it be full-stack webapp application development, cloud/data engineering, or and in-house computer vision ML model.
  
- Most recently, I'm leading a research team to build an automated drone warehouse inventory scanning system for IFA Group Charleston's main warehouse, a major global automotive-parts manufacturer. This is is a fully end-to-end system, from a user-friendly React UI for scheduling, reporting, and maintenance to the backend + drone system that is running multi-layered decision making inside of a 3D graph data structure + an A* Algorithm with custom hueristics relevant to our application (batteryCost, safetyCost, obstacleAvoidanceCost etc...). At the lowest level, we have computer vision models aiding with granular adjustments within our 3D "world" and performing the actual inventory scanning, resulting in 99% accurate barcode scanning across thousands of inventory locations. There is a tremendous amount of intermediary business logic, data translation, and subsystems within this greater system, so it's been a massive learning experience to design, implement, and integrate all of the subsystems to communicate and flow in harmony within the greater system.

- Techs: I have the most experience in a **Next.js/Prisma/PostgreSQL/AWS** stack, but have professional and personal experience across many other stacks such as:
  - Angular 16/Apollo/GraphQL<--->Spring/MongoDB/AWS (1yr @ Savvas Learning Company)
  - React<---->Flask/OpenCV/In-house ML models/Supabase<----->DJI Matrice Drone/DJI Mobile SDK (8mo @ Mercedes Benz USA + IFA Group)
  - React/Axios<-->Django/PSQL/AWS (6 months @ Vision Software Solutions)
  - Flutter<--->Firebase (Personal and School Projects)
  - Expo/React Native<--->Supabase (Personal and School Projects)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate and contribute to interesting projects!
