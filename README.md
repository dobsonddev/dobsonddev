### I'm Dobson, welcome to my repo ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m junior full-stack dev who loves building real-world solutions. Most recently, I'm leading a reseearch team to build anautomated drone warehouse inventory scanning system for a major global automotive manufacturer, IFA. I love collaborating and learning from those around me while solving interesting problems.

  - Angular 16/Apollo/GraphQL<--->Spring/MongoDB/AWS (1yr @ Savvas Learning Company)
  - React<---->Flask/OpenCV/In-house ML models/Supabase<----->DJI Matrice Drone/DJI Mobile SDK (8mo @ Mercedes Benz USA + IFA Group)
  - React/Axios<-->Django/PSQL/AWS (6 months @ Vision Software Solutions)
  - Flutter<--->Firebase (Personal and School Projects)
  - Expo/React Native<--->Supabase (Personal and School Projects)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate and contribute to interesting projects!
